Question 1 : -

The election is conducted in a city and everyone can vote for one or more candidates, or choose not to vote at all.
Each person has 1 vote so if they vote for multiple candidates, their vote gets equally split across these candidates. 
For example, if a person votes for 2 candidates, these candidates receive an equivalent of 0.5 vote each.
Some voters have chosen not to vote, which explains the blank entries in the dataset.
Find out who got the most votes and won the election. Output the name of the candidate or multiple names in case of a tie.
To avoid issues with a floating-point error you can round the number of votes received by a candidate to 3 decimal places.

Sol : -
select candidate from
(select candidate,  round(1/(count(candidate) over(partition by voter)),3) as score
from voting_results where candidate is not null and candidate !="") a
group by candidate
order by sum(score) desc
limit 1




Question 2 : -
For each video, find how many unique users flagged it. A unique user can be identified using the combination of their first name and last name. Do not consider rows in which there is no flag ID.


Sol : -
select video_id ,
count(distinct concat(coalesce(user_firstname, user_lastname))) as num_users
from user_flags
where flag_id is not null
group by video_id
